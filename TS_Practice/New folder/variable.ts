//strings
let greetings : string = "hello duniya";

console.log(greetings);



//number 

let userId : number = 12354;


//boolean

let isLoggedIn : boolean = true;

// variable declaration can also be like this:
// let isLoggedIn = true; 
// because ts is smart enough so that it can understand the type by its value ,it called typescript interferance
